Analysis of apartments for rent in colombia

in this Jupyter Botebook I analyse the aparments for rent in Colombia, before I have cleaned all the data because when it was scraped from https://www.metrocuadrado.com/
I get some outliers and many unusefull data.
Finally, a multivariable regression model is run capable of predicting the rental price of an apartment in Colombia.
